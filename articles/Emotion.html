<h4>Emotion</h4>
<p>Perceptual spaces are attributed desirability, and movement across desirability attributed emotion. This is a way of understanding
complex emotions as the product of composition of primary emotions. Two primary characteristics of perception, valence, i.e. reward
and punishment, and excitation, i.e. action-incentive and satiation-oriented, act as the basis for such composition, producing 
four abstract environments: action-rewarding, satiation-rewarding, action-punishing and satiation-punishing. Movement towards these 
abstract environments produces the most primary of emotion: excitement, joy, sadness, and fear.</p>

<p>Additional primary emotions result from voluntary movement across this perceptual space, namely hope, anger, contentment and
playfulness. Further complex emotions can be formed through the combination of these primitives and through their entry into social 
contexts.</p>
