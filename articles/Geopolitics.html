<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<p>Geopolitics is often used in a way that is synonymous to international relations, as both study the global phenomenon of war,
  trade and diplomacy. The distinguishing factor the deeper emphasis geopolitics places on the geographic factors at play, such as
  climate, topography, demography, and natural resource abundance.
</p>
<p>The first heuristic at play is one of constant war, of peoples grouped by nationality, ethnicity, religion, and culture, pursuing the 
  acquisition of natural resources through means of military force and games of attrition in the context of conventional warfare. This is 
  akin to the guiding principle of Imperialism, that might is right.
</p>
<p>
  Any man-made product no matter how complex, resolves at a fundamental level to the supply of natural resources, then developed into 
  complex products through industry and manufacturing. Natural resources include water, land, sunlight, vegetation, wildlife, and minerals.
  Natural resources are renewable if the rate of replenishment exceeds the rate of consumption, and non-renewable otherwise. Rare earth 
  elements, heavy rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are some examples of commonly sought after mineral groups. Critical minerals 
  are the minerals deemed most critical to economic stability and technological progress and varies from state to state. </p>
<p>
  A state can be profiled by the quantity and composition of its net imported and exported goods and services. A state can manipulate the 
  economic profile of itself or its counterparts through the use of economic tools such as sanctions (trade bans, travel bans, asset 
  freezes, etc.) and tariffs (import and export taxes) to strike a balance between protectionism and free trade. Excessive protectionist 
  measures may preclude a state from the economic opportunity of free trade, and thus slow the rate of technological progress in the absence 
  of foreign resources, as well as incentivise war. On the other hand, free trade de-incentivises the development of domestic industry through 
  an increased reliance on industry abroad. Thus, a state becomes vulnerable to the strategy of its counterparts.
</p>
<p>A blockade as a means of economic disruption is typically perceived as an act of war, given that the functioning of a state relies on the 
  functioning of its supply chains. These supply chains along with infrastructure both domestic and abroad (intelligence, energy, military, 
  command and control, etc.) all become primary targets during wartime. The prospect of nuclear warfare and the doctrine of MAD is often
  cited as an incentive for the pursuit of proxy warfare and regime change over direct conventional conflict. A higher occurrence of 
  brinksmanship may be another product of the doctrine of MAD, where state actors attempt to produce credible threats to their counterparts 
  whereby they risk the possibility of the worst-case outcome for both parties in order to have their counterparts capitulate to some 
  desired outcome. 
</p>
<p>The description of states thus far as goal-seeking entities performing and acting rationally in accordance with some geopolitical 
  calculus, is limited. A state is not a singular blank entity, it is an amalgam of state actors, multinationals, private and public 
  enterprise, small and local business, and citizens, of which all have some form of communicative interface with each other, of which
  all have a unique dialogue. Diplomacy, negotiation, trade summits, direct calls with counterparts, are all forms of state to state 
  communication. Televised addresses, political campaigns, protests, riots, are all forms of state to citizen and citizen to state 
  communication. Briefings, policy recommendations, lobbying, political donations, are all forms of state to institution communication.
  These institutions may include state or state-affiliated institutions (think tanks, intelligence agencies, multinationals etc.) as well 
  as private enterprise (industry representatives, lobbyists, etc.). Cultural and religious community events, festivities, as well as 
  everyday commentary and discussion, are the forms citizens take to discuss and promote ideals with one another.
