<h4>Perception of spatial position</h4>
<p>Proprioception is the perception of the position, velocity and acceleration of the joints of the body in space, relative to
    one another. Proprioception contributes to the body schema, the perception of the body as distinct from 
    environment, i.e. its position, boundary and spatial relationships with external objects.
</p>
<p>
    This is aided by equilibrioception: the perception of balance and the spatial position of the body with respect to gravity.
    Where tactition gives the body schema a deeper topology, proprioception and equilibrioception can be thought as describing 
    a more fundamental schema of voluntarily-controlled nodes in space, namely their existence, relative position, and movement.

    The wrists, shoulders, neck, pelvis, hips, ankles, and spine (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) all allow for frontal, sagittal 
    and transverse movement. As hinge joints, the elbows, knees and many of the finer joints of the hands and feet allow for 
    frontal movement, and to a lesser degree, sagittal and transverse movement. These planes of movement can be combined to 
    form sagittal-frontal, sagittal-transverse, and frontal-transverse movement. These joints exist adjacent to one another, 
    forming a kinematic chain. If not in freefall, the body has some set of joints in contact with the ground, which when 
    traversed to the body's centre of mass divide the joints into those that are free and those that are grounded, i.e. those 
    that do and do not lie on this traversal.

<p>The number and sequence of number points in contact with ground define the mode of travel, i.e. pentapedal, quadrupedal, 
    tripedal, etc., walk, jump or roll. A bipedal walk on two feet is the most obvious, though the category of bipedal walk
    includes the less obvious handstand walk. A continuous cartwheel could be considered a quadrupedal walk. The worm might be 
    considered a quadrapedal roll; quadrupedal in the sense that weight is transitioned between two feet and two hands, and 
    a roll in the sense that the transition of weight is not immediate but rather than through all intermediate joints.

<p>The diverse set of actions the body takes, the ability to run, jump, swim, climb, to sport, to grasp and manipulate objects,
is more than can be described with point cloud heuristics. For this we introduce physical characteristics, namely: flexibility, 
maximal strength, explosive strength, endurance strength, cardiovascular endurance and body composition. The ability to perform
desired actions and the ability to obtain the profile of characteristics required for such is simply a matter of rehearsal, 
assuming a baseline of certain pre-requisites (physical health, posture, sleep, and nutrition).</p>
