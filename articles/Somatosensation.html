<h4>Somatosensation</h4>
<p>Somatosensation is the perception of touch, which can be further subdivided into the perception of light touch, pressure, vibration,
tension and temperature. Two-point discrimination quantifies the disparate resolution of somatosensation across space. Two sharp points
are gently pressed against a somatosensory surface at distance great enough for the two points of contact to be perceied as distinct. This
distance is reduced until only a singular point of contact is perceived. The lips, fingers and feet have the highest two-point discrimination,
allowing for the topology of contact surfaces to be detected through deep static touch. Other aspects of somatosensation, namely vibration,
texture (roughness or softness of contact surface), temperature and tension, are perceived more evenly across all somatosensory surfaces.
Tension is perceived via the stretching of a surface and allows for the perception of slippage. Like other perceptual modalities, 
somatosensation relies more so on the change in detected stimuli than the stimuli itself. For instance, perception of the clothes on one's
skin decays rapidly. Nociception is the perception of pain, and is detected alongside most somatosensory surfaces.</p>
