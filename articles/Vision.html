<h4>Visual Perception</h4>
<p>Let us start with visual perception. Visual perception exists as the aggregate of perceived red, green, and blue light. These are the
primary colors. We can visualise transitions between the absence of light (black) and the presence of these primary colors as movement
through color space. Combined movement of these primary colors gives the secondary colors: magenta (red and blue), cyan (green and blue) 
and yellow (green and red). Combined movement of a primary color and a secondary color for which that primary color is not a component 
gives white (the presence of all colors in equal portion). Thus, we can encode color space spatially as a 3-dimensional cube, with black as the origin, white as the opposing vertex, primary colors as vertices of unit distance from black
and secondary colors as vertices of unit distance from white. Alternatively, we can leave this encoding aside and move through color space
perceptually without a spatial encoding.</p>

<p>Our spatial encoding of color space has resolution one, with points at each unit distance (vertices). Color space at higher resolution
allows for partial movements. At resolution two, the notion of saturation emerges as the length of the shortest path to a given color, and
brightness if the color in question is white or black. Tertiary colors also emerge at resolution two as combined distinct movements between
distinct primary colors. We could, if we so desired, define quarternary, quinary, etc., colors as colors introduced at incrementally higher
resolutions of color space that are not pre-existing vertices with altered brightness and saturation.</p>

<p>A color prism can be constructed for any subset of colors in color space. This prism represents the harmony of those colors at a 
resolution equal to resolution of the color space the prism is formed within. Additionally, a ring exists in color space at all 
resolutions and is formed between all primary and secondary colors one color movement apart. This ring contains all primary, secondary,
tertiary, etc., colors for which color harmonies in their most saturated form can be identified.</p>

<p>Visual Perception exhibits both immediate and gradual decay. The dissapearance of an object that highly contrasts its surrounding
environment leaves a momentary imprint that fades within milliseconds. An after-image that decays at a slower rate can be observed in the
absence of further visual input. The rate of decay of the after-image of a visual input appears to be proportional to the duration and
intensity gradient of the visual input that produced it. This after-image is perceived as the gradient map of the visual input with respect
to color and intensity. Movement or deformation of a visual input in the visual field imprints as singular inputs produced at the rate of
visual perception.</p>

<p>Further information processing takes a filtered form of this gradient map as input. A momentary burst of objects in the visual field
yields an equivalent trace that can be grouped and counted to an upwards of four groups of four objects. Larger groups are chunked,
five to three and two, seven to four and three, etc. An additional momentary flash across the visual field has no effect, however an
additional burst of objects in the visual field resets the grouping process, and thus only an upwards of two groups of two objects can be 
recalled from the initial burst.</p>
<p>Additional emergent properties of vision include reification, multistability, invariance and grouping. Reification is the inference
of boundaries that are not visibly perceived. Multistability describes the perceptual oscillation between multiple and individual
interpretations of a visual stimulus. Invariance is the perception of a singular object under
transformation (i.e. spatial translation, rotation, reflection, scale and elastic deformation). Grouping is the perception of common
properties across objects in the visual field (i.e., proximity, symmetry, continuity/closure, common fate, etc.).</p>
