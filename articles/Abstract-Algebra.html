<h4>Abstract Algebra</h4>
<p>Let \(G\) be a set. Let \(* : G \times G \rightarrow G\) be a binary operation. A group then is a tuple of the form \((G, *)\) such 
  that:
  <ol>
    <li>(Associativity) \( (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \forall a, b, c, \in G \)</li>
    <li>(Existence of Identity) \( \exists e \in G \>|\> a * e = e * a = a \> \forall a \in G \)</li>
    <li>(Existence of Inverses) \( \exists a \in G \implies \exists b \in G \>|\> a * b = b * a = e\) </li>
  </ol>
If the group also satisfies commutativity it is said to be an Abelian group: \( a * b = b * a \> \forall a, b \in G \).
</p>
<p>In set theory we talk about functions as mappings between sets. In group theory we talk about morphisms as structure-preserving 
  mappings between groups. For the two groups \((G, *)\) and \((H, \circ )\) a homomorphism \(f\) is the map: 
  \[f : G \rightarrow H \>|\> f(x * y) = f(x) \circ f(y) \> \forall x, y, \in G\]
If \( G = H \) then \(f\) is said to be the identity homomorphism. A homomorphism that is bijective is called an isomorphism. 
A homomorphism from \(G \rightarrow G\) is called an endomorphism, and an automorphism if also isomorphic.
