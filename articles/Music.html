<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Music can be viewed as harmony through auditory perception. 
    We start by generating a set of pitch ratios through combination of the partial set of the harmonics and subharmonics of any given pitch. 
The simpler pitch ratios that fall within the octave of that pitch are kept (e.g. 9/5, 10/9, 25/16 in the case of generation from
five harmonics). Five harmonics is the most practically useful, seeing as four harmonics generate four pitch ratios within the octave 
and seven harmonics generate thirty-eight. This tunes our octave perfectly with respect to a tonal root (the pitch selected as the 1:1 ratio
from which all other ratios are generated). This does mean that identical intervals between notes are not equivalent in terms of pitch. 
Thus, the system is out-of-tune with respect to these pitch ratios for any other tonal root. Chromaticism defines twelve pitch ratios within
the octave as twelve increments of the twelfth root of two. This approximates a system that is in tune no matter the tonal root. 
From these simple heuristics harmonic complexity emerges in the form of chords, scales, rhythm, polyrhythm, etc.</p>
