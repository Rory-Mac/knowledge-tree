<h4>Auditory Perception</h4>
<p>Auditory Perception is the perception of sound, which exists as the result of the complex combination of base frequencies. The 
fundamental frequency of a vibrating string is inversely proportional to its length. The frequencies we can perceive lie approximately
between 20-20000 cycles per second. Frequency corresponds to the sensory experience of pitch, and amplitude to volume. Our perception of 
sound is logarithmically weighted. A sound becomes twice as loud when amplitude is increased by an order of magnitude, and a sound
retains the same pitch class when frequency is doubled. We term the exponential multiples of two of a frequency as the octaves of that 
frequency. The octaves can be thought of as a subset of the harmonic series: the set of frequencies that exist as integer multiples of some
fundamental frequency.</p>
<p>Addition of frequencies create constructive and destructive interference. Modulation of frequencies occurs through
one frequency acting as the envelope for another (modulating either amplitude or frequency). Timbre exists as the unique tonal quality of 
a sound and exists as the complex result of the addition and modulation of a set of fundamental frequencies. This can be shown through
a spectrogram, a visualisation of the amplitude of all frequencies in the audible range across time.</p>
