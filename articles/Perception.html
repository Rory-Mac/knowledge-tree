<h4>Perception</h4> 
<p>Perceptual modalities produce perceptual spaces. The interoperation of these spaces produces perception. Modalities include vision,
proprioception, equilibrioception, audition, somatosensation, chemoreception, etc. The notion of objects and distance between objects
in a perceptual modality produces a perceptual space. In visual perception objects exist as groups of gradients in color space and 
distance as the degree of gradation between them. In proprioception and equilibrioception, objects exist as groups of points in
space that resist force and distance as the degree of exertion required for resistance against exertion to occur. In somatosensation,
objects exist as enclosed surfaces and distance as degree of slippage across and between these surfaces. In auditory perception,
objects exist as groups of frequencies and distance as difference in the properties of frequencies within and between groups. 
Chemoreception is less intuitively obvious, but still we can imagine objects as groups of primary properties such as tastes, odors,
physiological states, etc., and distance as the cardinality of the disjunction of these groups.</p>
