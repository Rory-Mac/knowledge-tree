<h4>Chemoreception</h4>
<p>Chemoreception is the perception of chemical stimuli. Gustation and olfaction are forms of chemoreception detecting the intake of 
chemical compounds. Gustation is the perception of taste for which there exist primary subdivisions of sweetness to detect sugars,
sourness to detect acids, saltiness to detect salts, bitterness to detect toxicity, and savoriness to detect protein. Olfaction is the
perception of smell, which in combination with gustation and somatosensation provides the perception of flavor. We can imagine subdividing
olfaction into primary odors from which complex odors result. These primary odors may include the following, though this is
speculative: floral, fruity, minty, nutty, pungent, putrid, woody, etc. Chemoreception also exists to detect and maintain the
concentration of chemical compounds associated with sleep, thirst, hunger, suffocation, nausea, sexual excitation. etc. Osmoreception is the
perception of the osmotic pressure of the fluids in which these compounds are suspended.</p>
